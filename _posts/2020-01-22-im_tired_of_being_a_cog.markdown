The youngest child in a family of 3 kids, from a small town in Indiana, with a blue color working dad and a mom in nursing school never seems like the worst thing till your older siblings figure out their lives as a whole and your parents split. An iron worker brother and a school teaching sister wouldn't make it seem like there was a lot of pressure on me to kinda figure it out, and it did exactly that; put no pressure on me. Life wasn't like most "small towns" describe it to be. As the only real way to grow is to leave that town and head to *the big city*. Coasting through highschool I did mostly STEM field classes like higher level math and engineering, but I focused mostly on architecture. Once I graduated, I pushed architecture aside and went full into mechanical engineering technology and did that full time, as well as work at a gas station, for 2 years. As signups for the 3rd year started I decided not to go and focused on myself and working full time at 2 jobs. 

The more and more I worked these dead end retail jobs the more I watned to make something of myself, and I was only **18** at the time! Two years go by and I meet a beautiful girl and we fall in love, shes originally from Arizona so we both move to Phoenix in the start of 2018. I start a job at a third party logistics company and just crunch numbers all day, call terminals, and work on emails till I punch out. I have always been into tech, from videogames at a young age to joining the robotics club in highschool. Yet I was too afraid to step into it becuase I just wanted a paycheck... That is what was the final straw, it was hunting for a paycheck and thats it. I was just a replacable cog in the coporate machine that if I fell dead in my chair, they would mourn, move me, and replace me. I couldn't stand the thought of that, but this 3pl job did give me a chance to learn a little SQL and work on an EDI system within our company. I was hooked, and I tried out Codecademy but needed to take it further.

I don't want to be replacable anymore, I want to be an asset they will fight for. I don't want to be a cog anymore, I want to be the whole machine.
