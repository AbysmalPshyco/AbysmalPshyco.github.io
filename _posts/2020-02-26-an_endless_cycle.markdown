Looping, for a quick minute, really threw me for a *loop* to say the least. The one thing that it really did help me understand is that it is a metaphor for life as much as it is a helpful tool. Looping can be used in many cases from an automation stand point so I wouldn't have to do the same thing over and over and over and over and over again, that in itself was annoying. Yet I see so many in life applications of both the process and the methods. The process of me, every weekday, getting up and making the same coffee, getting in the same car, going to the same job, leaving, coming home to sleep and then do it all over is a fantasic example of looping. The cycle of me doing most of my daily activites is, in a basic standpoint, a loop. Get up, live, sleep and repeat. Yes this sounds so bleak but its so true! I'll have to try and expand on this more when I get a moment.
